# What is MicroSMT PNPv3?
MicroSMT PNPv3 is an open-source pick-and-place machine kit designed specifically for compatibility with OpenPnP software. All the work started in 2021 and has been continuously iterated and improved ever since.


Like many classic DIY kits for OpenPnP, we continue to use a Cartesian XY design.

 Its main  components must be CNC-machined from aluminum alloy,Relying on robust aluminum alloy components, it achieves high-speed, high-precision operation.

# Innovative tensioner
We simply added a toothless idler to the classic kit, making belt tensioning effortless. This design offers a significant cost advantage.
